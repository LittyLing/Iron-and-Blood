							<p><span style = "margin-left: 40px">He</span> would like to go into the budget for 1862, 
							though without making a prejudicial statement. An abuse of constitutional rights could be 
							undertaken by any side; this would then lead to a reaction from the other side. The Crown, 
							e.g., could dissolve [parliament] twelve times in a row – that would certainly be permitted 
							according to the letter of the constitution – but it would be an abuse. It could just as 
							easily reject cuts in the budget, immoderately; it would be hard to tell where to draw the 
							line there; would it be at 6 million? At 16? Or at 60? – There are members of the National 
							Association [Nationalverein] – of this association that has achieved a reputation owing to 
							the justness of its demands – highly esteemed members who have stated that all standing 
							armies are superfluous. Well, what if a public assembly had this view! Would not a 
							government have to reject this?! – There was talk about the "sobriety" of the Prussian 
							people. Yes, the great independence of the individual makes it difficult in Prussia to 
							govern with the constitution (or to consolidate the constitution?); in France things are 
							different, there this individual independence is lacking. A constitutional crisis would not 
							be disgraceful, but honorable instead. – Furthermore, we are perhaps too "well-educated" 
							to support a constitution; we are too critical; the ability to assess government measures 
							and records of the public assembly is too common; in the country there are a lot of 
							catiline [conspiratorial] characters who have a great interest in upheavals. This may 
							sound paradoxical, but everything proves how hard constitutional life is in Prussia. – 
							Furthermore, one is too sensitive about the government's mistakes; as if it were enough to 
							say "this and that [cabinet] minister made mistakes,["] as if one wasn't adversely affected 
							oneself. Public opinion changes, the press is not [the same as] public opinion; one knows 
							how the press is written; members of parliament have a higher duty, to lead opinion, to 
							stand above it. We are too hot-blooded, we have a preference for putting on armor that is 
							too big for our small body; and now we're actually supposed to utilize it. Germany is not 
							looking to Prussia's liberalism, but to its power; Bavaria, Württemberg, Baden may indulge 
							liberalism, and yet no one will assign them Prussia's role; Prussia has to coalesce and 
							concentrate its power for the opportune moment, which has already been missed several 
							times; Prussia's borders according to the Vienna Treaties [of 1814-15] are not favorable 
							for a healthy, vital state; it is not by speeches and majority resolutions that the great 
							questions of the time are decided – that was the big mistake of 1848 and 1849 – but by 
							<b>iron and blood</b>. Last year's appropriation has been carried out; for whatever 
							reasons, it is a matter of indifference; he** is sincerely seeking the path of agreement: 
							whether he finds it does not depend on him alone. It would have been better if one had not 
							made a fait accompli on the part of the Chamber of Deputies. – If no budget comes about, 
							then there is a tabula rasa; the constitution offers no way out, for then it is one 
							interpretation against another interpretation; summum ius, summa iniuria; the letter 
							killeth. He is pleased that the speaker's remark about the possibility of another 
							resolution of the House on account of a possible bill allows for the prospect of 
							agreement; he, too, is looking for this bridge; when it might be found is uncertain. – 
							Bringing about a budget this year is hardly possible given the time; we are in exceptional 
							circumstances; the principle of promptly presenting the budget is also recognized by the 
							government; but it is said that this was already promised and not kept; [and] now [it's] 
							"You can certainly trust us as honest people." He does not agree with the interpellation 
							that it is unconstitutional to make expenditures [whose authorization had been] refused; 
							for every interpretation, it is necessary to agree on the three factors.</p>
