							<p>On April 1, 1815, Otto Eduard Leopold von Bismarck was born to a mother of government 
							ministers and a father of Prussian landowning nobility in Saxony. He was educated in 
							Berlin. He went on to study law at the University of Gottingen and the Universtity of 
							Berlin. After his studies at university, he held some diplomatic posts, ran his family 
							estate, and then became a politician. Bismarck was outspoken against liberalism, especially 
							during the Revolutions of 1848. He was, however, an advocate for German nationalistm and 
							unity.</p>

							<p>In 1861, William I became the King of Prussia. In 1862, he appointed Bismarck as his 
							chief minister. Bismarck, who was really in charge, delivered his famous "Iron and Blood" 
							speech, which expounded Prussia's will to achieve its goals in militaristic ways.</p>
							
							<p>Bismarck maintained his willingness to use "iron and blood" when he began a series of 
							wars that clearly demonstrated Prussia's ability at war, leadership, and politics. In 1864 
							he won the German-speaking Schleswig-Holstein territory from Denmark. In 1866, he defeated 
							the Austria, the dominant power (besides Prussia) in the German Confederation, in the 
							Austro-Prussian War. Finally, in 1870, Bismarck provoked the French to declare war 
							on Prussia by stirring political tension. Through the Franco-Prussian War from 1870 - 1871, 
							Prussia was able to unify the German states against a foreign enemy. The German states 
							swiftly defeated the French, and Prussia once more established its dominance.</p>
							
							<p>With the end of the Franco-Prussian War, Germany was unified under the Treaty of Versailles 
							of 1871. William I was crowned emperor of the newly unified German Empire, which became a 
							dominant nation state in Europe, greatly upsetting the balance of power.</p>
							
							<p>After Germany was unified, Bismarck focused on more domestic issues. Most notably, he 
							created a welfare state with nationale healthcare, insurance, and old age pensions to 
							combat the growing popularity of socialism.</p>

							<p>Kaiser Wilheim I died in 1888 and was succeeded by Friedrich III (who died from cancer 
							in 99 days) and Wilheim II. The new monarch opposed Bismarck's cautious inclination with 
							foreign policy; he favored more aggressive and rapid expansion. The two disagreed over 
							social, political, and economic issues, which only exacerbated the rift between them.</p>
							
							<p>Under Wilheim II's insistence, Bismarck resigned in 1890. He spent his final years warning 
							of the dangers of militaristic governments and conflict in the Balkans.</p>

							<p>By the time of his death, Bismarck was respected and honored, becoming a figure for 
							strong German leadership. He has been revered as a hero and German patriot, espeically 
							due to his crucial role in spearheading German unification. Many streets and monuments 
							are thus dedicated to him.</p>
